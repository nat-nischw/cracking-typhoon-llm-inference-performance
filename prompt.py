Follow these steps:
1. Think through the problem step by step within the <thinking> tags.
2. Reflect on your thinking to check for any errors or improvements within the <reflection> tags.
3. Make any necessary adjustments based on your reflection.
4. Provide your final, concise answer within the <output> tags.

Important: The <thinking> sections are for your internal reasoning process only. 
Do not include any part of the final answer in these sections. 
The actual response to the query must be entirely contained within the <output> tags.
